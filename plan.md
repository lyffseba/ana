## Sample Code Outline
Below is a basic example of how to structure the backend and frontend:

### Backend (Go with Gin)
```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

type Task struct {
    ID          int    `json:"id"`
    Title       string `json:"title"`
    Description string `json:"description"`
    DueDate     string `json:"due_date"`
    Priority    string `json:"priority"`
    ProjectID   int    `json:"project_id"`
    Status      string `json:"status"`
}

var tasks = []Task{
    {ID: 1, Title: "Meet Client", Description: "Discuss project requirements", DueDate: "2025-05-16", Priority: "High", ProjectID: 1, Status: "To-Do"},
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/tasks", getTasks)
    r.POST("/tasks", createTask)
    r.Run(":8080")
}

func getTasks(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, tasks)
}

func createTask(c *gin.Context) {
    var newTask Task
    if err := c.BindJSON(&newTask); err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
        return
    }
    newTask.ID = len(tasks) + 1
    tasks = append(tasks, newTask)
    c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, newTask)
}
```

        </form>
        <div id="task-list"></div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Deployment Configuration
### Netlify (Frontend)
- Push the frontend code to a GitHub repository.
- Connect the repository to Netlify via the Netlify dashboard.
- Set the publish directory to the folder containing HTML/CSS/JS files (e.g., `public`).

### Netlify Functions (Backend Option)
- Place Go function code in a `functions` directory.
- Use a `build.sh` script to compile Go binaries:
  ```bash
  GOBIN=$(pwd)/functions go install ./...
  ```
- Configure `netlify.toml`:
  ```toml
  [build]
    command = "./build.sh"
    functions = "functions"
    publish = "public"
  [build.environment]
    GO_IMPORT_PATH = "github.com/yourusername/ana-world"
    GO111MODULE = "on"
  [[redirects]]
    from = "/api/*"
    to = "/.netlify/functions/gateway/:splat"
    status = 200
  ```

### GCP (Backend Option)
- Containerize the Go app using Docker.
- Deploy to Google Cloud Run for scalability.
- Set up a subdomain (e.g., api.ana.world) pointing to the Cloud Run service.

## Considerations for Bogota
- **Language**: Ensure all UI text and API results (e.g., Places API) are in Spanish by setting the language parameter to `es`.
- **Local Suppliers**: Use location-based queries in the Places API to focus on Bogota (e.g., `location=4.7110,-74.0721&radius=5000`).
- **Cultural Design**: Incorporate earthy terra colors to align with local aesthetics, possibly inspired by Colombian landscapes.

## Iterative Development
To manage complexity, develop in phases:
1. **Core Task Management**: Build and deploy task CRUD operations.
2. **Project Management**: Add project features and daily agenda.
3. **Integrations**: Implement Google Calendar and Places API.
4. **Dashboards**: Develop financial and legal tracking.
5. **Refinement**: Enhance based on user feedback.

Involve your mom throughout to ensure the site is intuitive and meets her workflow needs.

## Potential Challenges
- **Netlify Functions Limitations**: Serverless functions may have cold starts or resource limits, impacting performance for complex operations.
- **Google API Costs**: Places API and Calendar API usage may incur costs; monitor usage in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Learning Curve**: If you’re new to HTMX or Go, allocate time to learn from tutorials.
- **User Adoption**: Ensure the interface is simple to avoid overwhelming your mom, who may not be tech-savvy.

## Conclusion
By following this plan, you can build a tailored project management tool for your mom’s architecture projects. Start with core features, leverage HTMX and Go for simplicity and performance, and integrate Google tools to enhance functionality. Deploy to Netlify for ease, with GCP as a scalable option, and prioritize best practices to ensure quality. Regular feedback from your mom will ensure the site is both functional and delightful to use.
